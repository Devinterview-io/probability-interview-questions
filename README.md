## 1. What is _probability_, and how is it used in _machine learning_?

**Probability** serves as the mathematical foundation of **Machine Learning**, providing a framework to make **informed decisions** in uncertain environments.

### Applications in Machine Learning

- **Classification**: Bayesian methods use prior knowledge and likelihood to classify data into target classes.
  
- **Regression**: Probabilistic models predict distributions over possible outcomes.

- **Clustering**: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) assign data points to clusters based on their probability of belonging to each.

- **Modeling Uncertainty**: Techniques like Monte Carlo simulations use probability to quantify uncertainty in predictions.


### Key Probability Concepts in ML

- **Bayesian Inference**: Updates the likelihood of a hypothesis based on evidence.

- **Expected Values**: Measures the central tendency of a distribution.

- **Variance**: Quantifies the spread of a distribution.

- **Covariance**: Describes the relationship between two variables.

- **Independence**: Variables are independent if knowing the value of one does not affect the probability of the others.

### Code Example: Computing Probability Distributions

Here is the Python code:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define input data
data = np.array([1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9])

# Create a probability mass function (PMF) using numpy and the data
def compute_pmf(data):
    unique, counts = np.unique(data, return_counts=True)
    pmf = counts / data.size
    return unique, pmf

# Plot the PMF
def plot_pmf(unique, pmf):
    plt.bar(unique, pmf)
    plt.title('Probability Mass Function')
    plt.xlabel('Unique Values')
    plt.ylabel('Probability')
    plt.show()

unique_values, pmf_values = compute_pmf(data)
plot_pmf(unique_values, pmf_values)
```
<br>

## 2. Define the terms '_sample space_' and '_event_' in _probability_.

In the field of probability, a **sample space** and an **event** are foundational concepts, providing the fundamental framework for understanding probabilities.

### Sample Space

The sample space, often denoted by $S$ or $\Omega$, represents all possible distinct outcomes of a random experiment. Consider a single coin flip. Here, the sample space, $S$, consists of two distinct outcomes: landing as either heads ($H$) or tails ($T$).

#### Formal Definition

For a random experiment, the sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of that experiment.

$$
S = \{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n\}
$$

### Event

**Events** are subsets of the sample space, defining specific occurrences or non-occurrences based on the outcomes of a random experiment.

Continuing with the coin flip example, let's define two events:

- $A$: The coin lands as heads
  - $A = \{H\}$
- $B$: The coin lands as tails
  - $B = \{T\}$

#### Formal Definition

An event $E$ is any subset of the sample space $S$. An event can be an individual outcome, multiple outcomes, or all the outcomes.

$$
E \subseteq S
$$

### Event Notation

#### Simple Events
  - An **element** of the sample space (e.g., $H$ for a coin flip).
  - Represented by a **single** outcome from the sample space.

#### Compound Events
  - A **combination** of simple events (e.g., "landing heads **and** a prime number" for a fair 6-sided die).
  - Represented by the **union**, **intersection**, or **complement** of simple events.

### Concept of Tail Event in Probability

In probability theory, a **tail event** is an event that results from the outcomes of a sequence of independent random variables. Such events often have either very low or high probabilities, making them of particular interest in certain probability distributions, including the Poisson distribution and the Gaussian distribution.
<br>

## 3. What is the difference between _discrete_ and _continuous probability distributions_?

**Probability distributions** form the backbone of the field of statistics and play a crucial role in machine learning. These distributions characterize the probability of different outcomes for different types of variables.

### Discrete Probability Distributions

- **Definition**: Discrete distributions map to countable, distinct values.
- **Example**: Binomial Distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of Bernoulli trials.
- **Visual Representation**: Discrete distributions are typically represented as bar graphs where each bar represents a specific outcome and its corresponding probability.
- **Probability Function**: Discrete distributions have a probability mass function (PMF), $P(X=k)$, where $k$ is a specific value.

### Continuous Probability Distributions

- **Definition**: Continuous distributions pertain to uncountable, continuous numerical ranges.
- **Example**: Normal Distribution represents a wide range of real-valued variables and is frequently encountered in real-world data.
- **Visual Representation**: Continuous distributions are displayed as smooth, continuous curves in probability density functions (PDFs), with the area under the curve representing probabilities.
- **Probability Function**: Continuous distributions use the PDF, $p(x)$. The probability within an interval is given by the integral of the PDF across that interval, i.e., $P(a \leq X \leq b) = \int_{a}^{b} p(x) \, dx$.

### Probability Distributions in Real-World Data

- **Discrete Distributions**: Discrete distributions are commonly found in datasets with distinct, countable outcomes. A classic example is survey data where responses are often in discrete categories.
- **Continuous Distributions**: Real-world numerical data, such as age, height, or weight, often follows a continuous distribution.
<br>

## 4. Explain the differences between _joint, marginal_, and _conditional probabilities_.

**Joint** probabilities quantify the likelihood of multiple events occurring simultaneously.

**Marginal** probabilities, derived from joint probabilities, represent the likelihood of individual events.

**Conditional** probabilities describe how the likelihood of one event changes given knowledge of another event.

### Mathematical Formulation

- **Joint Probability**: P(A \cap B)

- **Marginal Probability**: P(A) or P(B)

- **Conditional Probability**: P(A|B) or P(B|A)

### Visual Representation

![Visual Representation of Joint, Conditional, and Marginal Probabilities](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/dev-stack-app.appspot.com/o/probability%2Fconditional-marginal-and-joint-probabilities-min.png?alt=media&token=0a4b5860-dbd0-4ef6-879c-0fe05654eff4)

### Conditional Probability Calculation

The conditional probability of event A given event B is calculated using the following formula:

$$
P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
$$

### Marginal Probability Calculation

Marginal probabilities are obtained by summing (in the case of two variables, like X and Y) or integrating (in the case of continuous variables or more than two variables) the joint probabilities over the events not involved in the marginal probability. In the case of two variables X and Y, the marginal probability can be calculated as follows:

$$
P(X) = \sum_{i} P(X \cap Y_i)
$$
<br>

## 5. What does it mean for two events to be _independent_?

**Independence** in the context of probability refers to two or more events' behaviors where the occurrence (or non-occurrence) of one event does not affect the probability of the other(s).

### Types of Independence

- **Mutual Exclusivity**: If both events cannot occur at the same time, $P(A \text{ and } B) = 0$.
- **Conditional Independence**: When the occurrence of a third event sets two others as independent only under this particular condition. This is mathematically expressed as $P(A \text{ and } B | C) = P(A|C) \times P(B|C)$.

### Mathematical Representation

Two events, $A$ and $B$, are **independent** if and only if any one of the following three equivalent conditions holds:

$$
$$
P(A \text{ and } B) & = P(A) \times P(B) \\
P(B | A) & = P(B) \\
P(A | B) & = P(A) \\
$$
$$

The formula $P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B)$ is often associated with independent events, but it's just one of the above equivalent conditions and doesn't imply independence on its own.


### What Independence Doesn't Mean

- **Inexhaustibility**: Independence doesn't infer that the combined probability $P(A \text{ and } B)$ necessarily equals $1$. Events can be independent and still have a joint probability less than $1$.
<br>

## 6. Describe _Bayes' Theorem_ and provide an example of how it's used.

**Bayes' Theorem** is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows you to update your beliefs about an event based on new evidence.

### The Formula

The probability of an event, given some evidence, is calculated as follows:

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

Where:
- $P(A|B)$ is the **posterior** probability of $A$ given $B$
- $P(B|A)$ is the **likelihood** of $B$ given $A$
- $P(A)$ is the **prior** probability of $A$
- $P(B)$ is the **total probability** of $B$
  
### Example: Medical Diagnosis

Consider a doctor using a diagnostic test for a rare disease. If the disease is present, the test is positive $99\%$ of the time. If the disease is absent, the test is negative $99\%$ of the time. Given that only $1\%$ of the population has the disease, what is the probability that a person has the disease if their test is positive?

#### First, the Naive Calculation

Without considering the test accuracy and base rate, one might calculate the probability of having the disease given a positive test $P(D|+)$ as:

$$
P(D|+) = 0.99
$$

This calculation, however, neglects the reality that the disease is rare.

#### Applying Bayes' Theorem

To find the true probability using Bayes' Theorem, we break it down as:

$$
P(D|+) = \frac{P(+|D) \times P(D)}{P(+)}
$$

Where:
- $P(+|D) = 0.99$ is the probability of a positive test given the disease
- $P(D) = 0.01$ is the prior probability of having the disease
- $P(+)$ is the total probability of a positive test and can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:

$$
P(+) = P(+|D) \times P(D) + P(+|Â¬D) \times P(Â¬D)
$$

Substituting in the given values:

$$
P(+) = 0.99 \times 0.01 + (1 - 0.99) \times 0.99
$$
$$
P(+) \approx 0.01 + 0.01 = 0.02
$$

So,

$$
P(D|+) \approx \frac{0.99 \times 0.01}{0.02} = 0.495 \quad \text{or} \quad 49.5\%
$$

This means that even with a positive test result, **the probability of having the disease is less than 50\%** due to the test's false-positive rate and the disease's low prevalence.
<br>

## 7. What is a _probability density function (PDF)_?

A **probability density function (PDF)** characterizes the probability distribution of a continuous random variable $X$. Unlike discrete random variables, for which you can list all possible outcomes, continuous ones like the normal distribution can take any value within a range.

The PDF expresses the relative likelihood of $X$ falling within a specific interval. The absolute probability that $X$ lies within a range $a â‰¤ X â‰¤ b$ equals the area under the PDF curve over that interval.

### Properties of PDFs

- **Non-negative over the entire range**: $f(x) â‰¥ 0$
- **Area under the curve**: The integral of the PDF over the entire range equals 1.
  
$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \, dx = 1
$$

### Relationships: PDF, CDF, and Expected Value

- **Cumulative Density Function (CDF)**: Represents the probability that $X$ takes a value less than or equal to $x$.

Mathematically, the CDF is obtained by integrating the PDF from $-\infty$ to $x$.

$$
F(x) = P(X \leq x) = \int_{-\infty}^{x} f(t) \, dt
$$

- **Expected Value**: Also known as the mean of the distribution, it gives the center of "gravity" of the PDF.

For continuous random variables:

$$
E(X) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x \cdot f(x) \, dx
$$

### Practical Example: Normal Distribution

The **normal distribution** describes many natural phenomena and often serves as a first approximation for any unknown distribution.

Its PDF is given by the mathematical expression:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}} \cdot e^{ \frac{-(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} }
$$

Where:

- $\mu$ represents the mean.
- $\sigma^2$ serves as the variance, controlling the distribution's width. The square root of the variance yields the standard deviation $\sigma$.
<br>

## 8. What is the _role_ of the _cumulative distribution function (CDF)_?

The **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)** provides valuable insights in both discrete and continuous probability distributions by characterizing the probability distribution of a random variable. By evaluating the CDF at a given point, we can determine the probability that the random variable is below (or equal to) that point.


### Visual Representation

![Cumulative Distribution Function](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/dev-stack-app.appspot.com/o/probability%2Fcumulative-distribution-function-min.png?alt=media&token=c8434649-58f7-4d50-acb0-f101cd91eae1)

### Practical Applications

- **Visualizing and Understanding Distributions**: The CDF is beneficial for exploring datasets, as it offers a graphical portrayal of data distributions, allowing for quick inferences about characteristic features.
- **Quantifying the Likelihood of Outcomes**: Once the CDF is known, it becomes straightforward to compute probabilities for specific outcomes.

### Key Mathematical Insights

- **Monotonicity**: The CDF is a monotonically increasing function. As the input value increases, so do the output values.
- **Bounds**: For any real number, the CDF value falls between $0$ and $1$.
- **Characterizing the Distribution**: The CDF is the official standard for unraveling any probability distributions, with its form, either explicit or implicit, catering to that particular goal.

### Calculating Efficacy

While the exact form of a CDF can be complex, numerical techniques and **quantiles** offer straightforward methods for evaluation and interpretation.

### Formal Definition:

For a random variable $X$  with a probability density function (PDF) $f(x)$ and a cumulative distribution function (CDF) $F(x)$, the relationship can be formalized as:

$$
F(x) = P(X \leq x) = \int_{-\infty}^{x} f(t) \, dt
$$

where the integral may be replaced by a summation in the case of discrete distributions.

### Mathematical Representation

The CDF is given by:

$$
F(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{x} f(u) \, du
$$

where $f(u)$ is the PDF of the random variable and the integral is evaluated from $-\infty$ to $x$.
<br>

## 9. Explain the _Central Limit Theorem_ and its significance in _machine learning_.

The **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** serves as a foundational pillar for statistical inference and its implications are widespread across machine learning and beyond.

### The Core Concept

The CLT states that given a sufficiently large sample size from a population with a finite variance, the **distribution of the sample means** will converge to a normal distribution, regardless of the shape of the original population distribution.

In mathematical terms, if we have a sample of $n$ random variables $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, then the sample mean $\bar{X}$ will approximately follow a normal distribution as the sample size, $n$, grows larger:

$$
\bar{X} \approx N\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n}\right)
$$

### Visual Representation

Below is an example illustrating the transformation of a non-normally distributed dataset to one that adheres to a normal distribution as the sample size increases:

![(CLT) Central Limit Theorem](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/dev-stack-app.appspot.com/o/probability%2Fcentral-limit-theorem.jpeg?alt=media&token=77096b65-5825-4d40-839a-9c8b7542262d)

### The Significance in Machine Learning

The Central Limit Theorem is Intricately woven into various areas of machine learning:

1. **Parameter Estimation**: It makes possible point estimation techniques like maximum likelihood estimation and confidence interval estimation.
  
2. **Hypothesis Testing**: It underpins many classical statistical tests, such as the Z-test and t-test to evaluate the significance of the sample data.

3. **Model Evaluation Metrics**: It validates the use of metrics like the mean and variance across cross-validations, boosting the reliability of model assessments.

4. **Error Distributions**: It justifies the assumption of normally distributed errors in several regression techniques.

5. **Algorithm Design**: Many iterative algorithms, like EM algorithm and stochastic gradient descent, leverage the concept to refine their estimations.

6. **Ensemble Methods**: Techniques like bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) and stacking exploit the theorem, further enriching prediction accuracy.
<br>

## 10. What is the _Law of Large Numbers_?

The **Law of Large Numbers** (LLN) represents an essential statistical principle. It states that as the size of a sample or dataset increases, the sample mean will tend to get closer to the population mean.

In an experiment with **independent** and **identically distributed** (i.i.d) random variables, the LLN assures convergence in probability. This implies that the probability of the sample mean differing from the true mean by a certain threshold reduces as the sample size grows.

### Mathematical Formulation

Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be i.i.d random variables with the same expected value, $\mu$.

According to the Weak Law of Large Numbers (WLLN), the sample mean $\overline{X}_n$ converges to the population mean $\mu$ in probability:

$$
\lim_{{n \to \infty}} \mathbb{P}\left( | \overline{X}_n - \mu | \ge \varepsilon \right) = 0, \quad \text{for any } \varepsilon > 0
$$

In other words, the probability that the sample mean deviates from the population mean by more than $\varepsilon$ approaches zero as $n$ grows.

### Practical Implications

- **Sample Size Significance**: It underscores the need for sufficiently large sample sizes in statistical studies.
- **Survey Accuracy**: Larger survey data generally provides more reliable insights.
- **Financial Forcasting**: Greater historical data can lead to more accurate estimates in finance.
- **Risk Assessment**: More data can enhance the precision in evaluating potential risks.

### Code Example: Law of Large Numbers

Here is the Python code:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

np.random.seed(0)

# Generate random data from a standard normal distribution
data = np.random.randn(1000)

# Calculate the running sample mean
running_mean = np.cumsum(data) / (np.arange(1, 1001))

# Plot the running sample means
plt.plot(running_mean, label='Running Sample Mean')
plt.axhline(np.mean(data), color='r', linestyle='--', label='True Mean')
plt.xlabel('Sample Size')
plt.ylabel('Mean')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
<br>

## 11. Define _expectation, variance_, and _covariance_.

**Expectation**, **variance**, and **covariance** are fundamental mathematical concepts pertinent to understanding probability distributions.

### Expectation (Mean)

The **expectation**, represented as $\mathbb{E}[X]$ or $\mu_x$, is akin to the "long-run average" of a random variable.

It is calculated by the weighted sum of all possible outcomes, where the weights are given by the probability of each outcome, $P(X=x_i)$:

$$
\mathbb{E}[X] = \sum_{i} P(X=x_i) \cdot x_i
$$

In a continuous setting, the sum is replaced by an integral:

$$
\mathbb{E}[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x \cdot f(x) \, dx
$$

where $f(x)$ is the probability density function (PDF) of the random variable $X$.

### Variance

The **variance**, denoted as $\text{Var}(X)$ or $\sigma^2$, is a measure of the "spread" or "dispersion" of a random variable about its mean.

It is calculated as the expected value of the squared deviation from the mean:

$$
\text{Var}(X) = \mathbb{E}[(X - \mathbb{E}[X])^2] = \mathbb{E}[X^2] - (\mathbb{E}[X])^2
$$

where $\mathbb{E}[X^2] = \sum_{i} P(X=x_i) \cdot x_i^2$ for discrete random variables, and $\mathbb{E}[X^2] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^2 \cdot f(x) \, dx$ for continuous random variables.

### Covariance

The **covariance**, symbolized as $\text{Cov}(X, Y)$, measures the degree to which two random variables **co-vary** or change together. A positive covariance indicates a positive relationship, while a negative value suggests an opposite or negative association.

Mathematically, given two random variables $X$ and $Y$, their covariance is computed as:

$$
\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \mathbb{E}[(X - \mathbb{E}[X]) \cdot (Y - \mathbb{E}[Y])]
$$

In terms of their joint probability, $\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \mathbb{E}[XY] - \mathbb{E}[X] \cdot \mathbb{E}[Y]$.

An alternative formula based on the definitions of expectation is:

$$
\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \sum_{x}\sum_{y}{(x_i - \mu_x) \cdot (y_j - \mu_y) \cdot p(x_i, y_j)}
$$

where $p(x_i, y_j)$ is the joint probability mass function for discrete random variables, and for continuous random variables, it becomes:

$$
p(x, y) = f(x, y) \cdot \delta x \cdot \delta y
$$

The Kronecker delta function $\delta x \delta y$ represents a very small square or rectangular area around the point $(x, y)$.
<br>

## 12. What are the characteristics of a _Gaussian (Normal) distribution_?

The **Gaussian distribution**, also known as the **Normal distribution**, is a key concept in probability and statistics. Its defining characteristic is its **bell-shaped curve**, which provides a natural way to model many real-world phenomena.

### Key Characteristics

1. **Location and Spread**: Described by parameters  $\mu$ (mean) and $\sigma$ (standard deviation), the Gaussian distribution is often centered around its mean, with fast decays in the tails.


2. **Symmetry**: The distribution is symmetric around its mean. The area under the curve is 1, representing the totality of possible outcomes.


3. **Inflection Points**: The points of maximum curvature, known as inflection points, lie $\pm \sigma$ from the mean.


4. **Standard Normal Form**: A Gaussian with $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$ is in its standard form.


5. **Empirical Rule**: This rule states that for any Gaussian distribution, about 68% of the data lies within $\pm 1$ standard deviation, 95% within $\pm 2$ standard deviations, and 99.7% within $\pm 3$ standard deviations of the mean.

### Formula

The probability density function (PDF) for a Gaussian distribution is:

$$
f(x \ | \ \mu, \sigma^2) = \frac{1}{{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}}} \exp\left(-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
$$

Where:

- $x$ represents a specific value or observation
- $\mu$ is the mean
- $\sigma$ is the standard deviation

### Visual Representation

![Gaussian Distribution](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Normal_Distribution_PDF.svg)

In the context of the **Empirical Rule**, notice the intervals of $\mu \pm \sigma, \mu \pm 2\sigma,$and $\mu \pm 3\sigma$ enclosing a proportion of the curve's area.

### Gaussian Distributions in Nature

Numerous natural systems exhibit behavior that aligns with a Gaussian distribution, including:

- **Human Characteristics**: Variables such as height, weight, and intelligence often conform to a Gaussian distribution.
- **Biological Processes**: Biological phenomena, such as heart rate variability and the duration of animal movements, are frequently governed by the Gaussian distribution.
- **Environmental Events**: Natural occurrences such as floods, rainfall, and wind speed in many regions adhere to a Gaussian model.


The Gaussian Distribution proves equally valuable in artificial systems, from finance to machine learning, owing to its mathematical elegance and widespread applicability.
<br>

## 13. Explain the utility of the _Binomial distribution_ in _machine learning_.

The **Binomial Distribution** is a key probability distribution in machine learning and statistics. It models the number of successes in a fixed number of **independent Bernoulli trials**.

### Application in Machine Learning

- **Classification**: In a binary classifier, each example is a Bernoulli event; the binomial distribution helps estimate the number of correct predictions within a set.

- **Feature Selection**: Assessing the significance of a feature in a dataset can be done in binary settings, where we calculate if the resulting classes are distributed in a manner not compatible with a 50-50 division.

- **Model Evaluation Metrics**: Binomial calculations are behind widely used model evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores.

- **Ensemble Learning**: Techniques like Bagging and Random Forest involve numerous bootstrap samples, essentially Bernoulli trials, to build diverse classifiers resulting from resampling methods.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Algorithms like Grid Search or Random Search often rely on cross-validated performance measures exhibiting a binomial nature.

### Specific Use Cases

1. **Quality Assurance**: Determine the probability of a machine learning-based quality control mechanism correctly identifying faulty items.

2. **A/B Testing**: Analyzing user responses to two different versions of a product, such as a website or an app.

3. **Revenue Prediction**: Predicting customer behavior, such as converting to a paid subscription, based on historical data.

4. **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying unusual patterns in data, such as fraudulent transactions in finance.

5. **Performance Monitoring**: Evaluating the reliability of systems or their components.

6. **Risk Management**: Estimating and managing various types of risks in business or financial domains.

7. **Medical Diagnosis**: Assessing the performance of diagnostic systems in identifying diseases or conditions.

8. **Weather Forecasting**: Identifying extreme weather occurrences from historical patterns.

9. **Voting Behavior Analysis**: Assessing the likelihood of an event, like winning an election, based on survey results.
<br>

## 14. How does the _Poisson distribution_ differ from the _Binomial distribution_?

Both the **Poisson** and the **Binomial** distributions relate to counts, but they're applied in different settings and have key distinctions.

#### Key Differences

- **Nature of the Variable**: The Poisson distribution is used for counts of rare events that occur in a fixed time or space interval, while the Binomial distribution models the number of successful events in a fixed number of trials.
- **Number of Trials**: The Poisson distribution assumes an infinite number of trials, while the Binomial distribution has a fixed, finite number of trials, $n$.
- **Probability of Success**: In the Binomial distribution, $p$ remains constant across trials, representing the probability of a success. In the Poisson, $p$ becomes infinitesimally small as $n$ becomes large to approximate a rare event.

#### Common Ground

Both distributions deal with **discrete random variables** and are characterized by a single parameter:

- **Poisson Distribution**: The single parameter, $\mu$, denotes the average rate of occurrence for the event.
- **Binomial Distribution**: The single parameter, $n$ the number of trials, and $p$ the probability of success on each trial, together determine the shape of the distribution.

### Probability Mass Functions

#### Poisson Distribution

The probability mass function (PMF) of the Poisson distribution is defined as:

$$
P(X=k) = \frac{e^{-\mu}\mu^k}{k!}
$$

Where:
- $k$ is the count of events that occurred in the fixed interval.
- $\mu$ is the average rate at which events occur in that interval, also known as the Poisson parameter.
- $e$ is Euler's number, approximately 2.71828.

#### Binomial Distribution

The probability mass function (PMF) of the Binomial distribution is defined as:

$$
P(X=k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
$$

Where:

- $k$ is the number of successful events.
- $n$ is the total number of independent trials.
- $p$ is the probability of success on each trial.
  
### Visualization

The shape of the Poisson distribution is **unimodal**, with the PMF reaching its maximum at $\mu$. As $\mu$ increases, the distribution becomes more spread out.

![Poisson Distribution](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/Poisson_pmf.svg)

The Binomial distribution is **less smooth** and can be symmetric or skewed, depending on the value of $p$. As the number of trials, $n$, grows larger, the distribution starts to resemble a Poisson distribution when $np$ is fixed.

![Binomial Distribution](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Binomial_distribution_pmf.svg)
<br>

## 15. What is the relevance of the _Bernoulli distribution_ in _machine learning_?

**Bernoulli distribution** is foundational to **probabilistic models**, including some key techniques in **Machine Learning**, such as **Naive Bayes** and various binary classification algorithms.

### Key Concepts

- **Binary Outcomes**: The Bernoulli distribution describes the probability of success or failure when  $n = 1$.
For instance, in **Binary Classification**, where there are only two possible outcomes:  $y \in \left\lbrace 0, 1 \right\rbrace$.

- **Probabilistic Classification**: In binary classification, the model estimates the probability of a sample belonging to the positive class. This estimate stems from the Bernoulli distribution. 

- **Independence Assumption**: Some models, like **Naive Bayes**, assume feature independence, simplifying the joint probability into a product of individual ones. Each feature is then modeled using a separate Bernoulli distribution.

### Practical Applications

The Bernoulli distribution is employed in numerous real-world contexts, enabled by its implementation in diverse Machine Learning projects. Common domains include **Natural Language Processing**, **Image Segmentation**, and **Medical Diagnosis**.

#### Code Example: Bernoulli in Naive Bayes

Here is the Python code:

```python
from sklearn.naive_bayes import BernoulliNB
import numpy as np

# Binary features
X = np.random.randint(2, size=(100, 3))
y = np.random.randint(2, size=100)

# Multinomial Naive Bayes
clf = BernoulliNB()
clf.fit(X, y)
```
